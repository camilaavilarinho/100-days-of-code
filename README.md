# 100 Days Of Code
A challenge to commit myself to code everyday for 100 days in a row

##Rules
* I'll [code everyday and commit on github](#daily-update-white_check_mark) to track the evolution and my commitment with the project
* I'll build real and useful projects that can become my portfolio after
* I'll use the best programming practices (let me know if you see the opposite of that in my codes, I'll be thankful)
* I'll use the best technologies
* I'll keep a repository of each project and this one as a general for the challenge, with the links to the daily commits
* The commits will be [daily](#daily-update-white_check_mark), but I'll explain and organize the documents only in the weekends
* I'll keep a list of daily work, like a journal but I'll not post it here. It will be used just to organize the progress of the project on weekends
* I'll write everything in english(documentation and code)
* This project does NOT include the theoretical part of knowledge, only practice. Will not be counted the time spent on tutorials, courses or books, only what can be committed as project.
